# Simple Weather App

The goal with this project is to build the same weather app I made [here](https://github.com/ItsJameson/simple-weather-app-ejs). But this time learning and using React for the first time instead of ejs.
I also took this opportunity to learn and use tailwind-css.

Currently the front end is about finished.
Next step is to integrate the weather API.

**Uses:** \
React \
Tailwind css \
Typescript
